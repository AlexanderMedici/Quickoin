   <li><b>Speeding up international transactions.</b> It still takes a long time to make international payments as each intermediary bank checks the transaction data and thus delays the receipt of the payment.

   <li><b>No governmental control.</b> This is a rather dubious advantage since cryptocurrencies in the hands of cybercriminals and lack of control is not the best scenario. However, blockchain enables companies to earn money honestly and allows users to spend it at their discretion.

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build": "react-scripts build"`,

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

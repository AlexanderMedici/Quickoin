## Description 
A full-fledged application which allows users to send transactions anywhere in the world, through the blockchain. Each transaction is paired with a GIF & stored forever on the digital ledger. 

Users can login with their metamask ethereum wallet to Quickkoin. They will then be prompted to fill out a secure form detailing to whom they wish to send crypto to, and the amount they wish to send. The transaction will then be sent over the blockchain. A GIF will be attached to the transaction so that it can be tracked by the sender. Currently the only crypto that can currently be sent is Ethereum. However the receiver can choose if they wish to convert it into their preferred crypto. In which case whatever the exchange value of Ethereum is into the crypto chosen, will be the amount the receiver ends up with. 

## Use Case

- Send and receive crypto over the blockchain quickly to friends and family, globally
- Pay for an item or product to the seller through this platform, and confirm the payment 
- Can be used to send or receive money without using traditional banks 
- Can be used instead of a traditional method to prove that payments have been received
- Can be used to store details of a transaction forever on the digital ledger with an GIF of choice

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `"npm run build": "react-scripts build"`,

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy!

### `"npm run test": "react-scripts test"`,

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"serve": "node server"`

For running the server file you can use this command.

### `npm run serve`
